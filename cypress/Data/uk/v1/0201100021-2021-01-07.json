Half-carcases are derived from whole carcases by division through each cervical, dorsal, lumbar and sacral vertebra, through or along the sternum and through the ischio-pubic symphysis. These carcases or half-carcases may be with or without head, with or without the chaps, feet, flare fat, kidneys, tail or diaphragm. Half-carcases may be with or without spinal cord, brain or tongue.

The parts of the cuts defined in paragraph 2(A)(f) fall in the same subheadings, only if they contain rind and subcutaneous fat.\r\n\r\nIf the cuts falling in subheadings 0210 11 11, 0210 11 19, 0210 11 31, 0210 11 39, 0210 19 30 and 0210 19 60 are derived from a bacon side from which the bones indicated under paragraph 2(A)(g) have already been removed, the lines of cutting must follow those defined under paragraph 2(A)(b), (c) and (d) accordingly; in any case, these cuts or parts thereof must contain bones.\r\n\r\n  * C\\. Subheadings 0206 49 00 and 0210 99 49, include, in particular, heads or halves of heads of domestic swine, with or without the brains, cheeks or tongues, and parts thereof.\r\n\r\n* The head is separated from the rest of the half-carcase as follows:\r\n    * \\- by a straight cut parallel to the cranium; or\r\n    * \\- by a cut parallel to the cranium up to the level of the eyes and then inclined to the front of the head, thereby causing the chaps to remain attached to the half-carcase.\r\n\r\n  The cheeks, snouts and ears as well as the meat attached to the head, particularly to the rear part, are considered parts of heads. However, the cuts of boneless meat of the fore-end, presented alone (jowls, chaps, or chaps and jowls together), fall in subheading 0203 19 55, 0203 29 55, 0210 19 50 or 0210 19 81, as the case may be.\r\n\r\n  * D\\.
